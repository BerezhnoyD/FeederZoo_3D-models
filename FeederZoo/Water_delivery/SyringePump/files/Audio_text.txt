The purpose of this video is to show one way to calibrate the rotation of the motor with the amount of fluid deposited by the syringe.

The method is to use a 1 milliliter syringe to measure the larger 10 milliliter syringe volume during one rotation of the motor.

The software is modified to turn the motor one turn or 200 steps.

The syringes are partially filled with water, colored in this case, and connected together by a one quarter inch clear vinyl tube.

Try to keep the air bubbles to a minimum while filling the syringes with water.

Install the 10 milliliter syringe in the syringe pump.

Reverse the motor until the syringe just fits. install the syringe clips

Run the pump one turn 

The initial reading will include hysteresis so it will not be used except as a starting point.

Run the pump again and record the new amount indicated on the small syringe.

Continue until the end of the syringe is reached, do not go over 1 milliliter.

Take the differences in the readings, then take an average of the readings.

Repeat this procedure as many times as necessary to feel that you know the amount of fluid from one rotation.
