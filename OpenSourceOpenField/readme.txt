This repository includes all the designs to make a module open-field box
40x40cm in size using the 5mm Acrylic Sheets.

Instructions:
For one Open field you will need to cut 5 Acrylic sheets and print 4 corners to
hold them together

1. Using the Laser Cutter (we used VLS 4.60 Laser Cutter) cut 4 side walls using 
the Illustrator files provided (Open field box-wall.ai). All walls are cut using
the same design and are hold together by the slots/spikes on the opposite side,
making all of them interchangeable. 
Use white acrylic sheets (3mm thickness) for the walls and don't remove the protective paper, 
otherwise the laser will leave the black burned marks on the surface.

2. Using the Laser Cutter cut the groves in a 5mm acryllic sheet to use it as an open-field
base. Groves are needed to hold 4 walls in place and should be at least 2-3mm deep, the deeper
the better. Provided Illustrator file (Open field box-bottom.ai) has only one grove (in grey)
as we have found that simply engraving one at a time and then rotating the sheet manually takes
much less time then engraving all. You might also want to experiment with the speed of the laser
cutter to make the grove deeper, or make some adjustments to the design

3. Using the PLA 3d printer and provided design (Open field box-corner.stl) print 4 corners to hold
the walls together. The open field can be used even without the corners due to its design,
but they add additional stability.

4. Assemble the parts in place - put the base on the floor, insert 4 walls into each other (spikes into
slots) and the base, and finish with putting 4 corners on top. The open field is ready for your experiments.
To wipe the base after the experiment you can simply lift 4 walls and then put them back in place.
